## Vehicle Variation Packs (Car Variation Changer)
This mod allows you to load custom variations for vehicle colors, reflecting a more realistic distribution. Currently, there are 5 preinstalled packs:


- **Realistic Global** - A more realistic distribution of colors. Generalized for all vehicles, based on real world data
- **Vanilla** - The default game colors
- **German Vehicle Pack** - Realistic Global with German Service Vehicle Variations
- **Japan** - Japanese Service Vehicles
- **Vancouver, Canada** - Vancouver Service Vehicles
		

## Features
- Affects Colors of Personal Vehicles, Parked Vehicles, Motorcycles, and Service Vehicles
- Supports user-created variation packs (create json files in mod folder)
- Change active variation in the mod settings during gameplay, no reload/restart required

## Create your own Packs
Create your own packs using the [Variation Pack Creator](https://variationpackcreator.mimonsi.de/). The link can also be found in the Mod Settings.

## Cascading Packs
The mod will only override assets that are explicitly included in the pack. That means, that you can choose a pack that changes all assets, and then switch to a pack that only changes police cars, and the police cars will be changed to the new pack, while all other vehicles will remain the same as the first pack.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to **krzychu124** for helping me with the first steps of accessing vehicle color.
